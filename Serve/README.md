## Getting started

1. Clone this repository and `cd Serve`.
2. Download the latest version of `odot_crash_data.sql` from Google Drive here.
3. Set the environment variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to a strong password. This will become the password for the `postgres` superuser inside the PostGIS service container.
4. Type `docker-compose up -d`.
